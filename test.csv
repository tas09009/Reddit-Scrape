Both pens come with original boxes; I'll empty &amp; clean the Mini before it goes. 

1. **Pilot Custom 74, forest green** (North America exclusive, retails for $160 as a result)**, F nib - \[B\] condition:** Catch and release from another lovely swapper. It's a gorgeous pen, I just don't jive with the C74 F as much as my other Pilot Fs, and I maaaay have overcorrected on my previous lack of green pens... it's in pretty flawless condition; I only dipped it, and rated it B because I'm not the first owner. **$130**
2. SOLD **~~TWSBI Diamond Mini AL, mint blue, EF...italic...nib? - \[B\] condition body, \[D\] for nib grind~~**: After several rounds of bad personal luck with Diamond Minis (USPS eating my pen when I sent it out for a nib tuning, tuning gone awry, and the adventure with this nib I'm about to describe) I'm throwing in the towel. I wish I had taken a picture of the factory nib that was my last hurrah - I got another one to replace the nib that got tuned too broadly, but the nib arrived with a really strange tip, with a VERY thin connection between the actual nib tipping and the rest of the nib - it was basically shaped like a Sorry! board game piece, but even more dramatic - and the tines were misaligned. Anyway, when I attempted to align them, the tipping straight up ***snapped off.*** To salvage it, I gave it what is essentially an italic grind, although since the nib tip is so small, it's a very, very subtle one. It now writes with quite a fine (though fairly wet) line with a tiny bit of line variation and a little bit of feedback, and it works - it's just not the thing I wanted on this pen, and I think the universe is telling me to give up! The body etc. are in perfect condition; I babied the heck out of this thing. **$45**

**1. Unbranded button filler, [D], steel semiflex nib.** Missing the clip and top jewel. I filled in the jewel socket with clear epoxy. The nib is marked ""Flexible"" but is more of a springy semiflex. Goes from F to B with moderate pressure. Also has a handy clear ink window in the section.

**2. Unbranded lever filler, [D], steel medium-ish nib.** Rated D because it's got a lot of wear on the trim. This is a smallish pen, a little bigger than a kaweco sport. The nib writes like a western medium. It's untipped steel, so it can be a little scratchy at the wrong angle but otherwise writes well.

**3. Ambassador combo pen, [D], 14k soft nib.** D rating for nib work and because I haven't tested the pencil half of the pen. The nib has very little tipping material left and needed some work to write properly. It is fairly smooth, but has a distinct ""sweet spot."" Writes somewhere between a western F and M width.

* Sailor Kingdom Note PGM with Cursive Italic grind by CY (TokyoStationPens) \[B\]. I adore this pen, but I just don’t use it enough to justify keeping it. It’s perfect, except I have mammoth hands and it makes mine cramp. CY’s grind is amazing as always, and I’ll include a converter that didn’t come with it but I have no need for.

This is a beautiful pen, and I had planned to keep it forever when I got it, hence the engraving. It’s about 300 per Onoto to remove the engraving. You’ll have to send it in to them to get it done, but they say it can be removed completely. Due to that, I’m dropping the price on this one since the buyer will have to go through work to get it. It has a wonderful medium cursive italic nib that writes gorgeously. I’m sad to be getting rid of this one, but once again it’s been a hard year.

# All three of these pens can be yours for the low price of $30 shipped! (REDUCED FROM $36)

**I have a couple of things up for offer today. These are all pens that I bought new off Amazon, and each one of them has a caveat (or two) that I find slightly annoying. They are all in good condition, each having been inked only a couple of times. I haven't included writing samples in the gallery because I forgot to bring an ink with me to dip test them in after cleaning, but if you would like to request one I wouldn't mind setting that up.**

Enough about that, [here are the pens](https://imgur.com/a/16cx7MN) (and verification).

**First is a** **Moonman P135 (C+/B-)** **with an extra-fine nib.** This pen is a wonderful writer with one of the smoothest extra fine nibs I've had. It is closer to a western extra fine- I find it to be somewhere between a western EF nib and a Japanese F nib, as it's just *slightly* finer than a Japanese fine and just *slightly* broader than a western extra fine. It's quite a wet writer. The caveat about this one is that the convertor likes to come loose quite easily, and used to pop out occasionally when the barrel of the pen was unscrewed from the section. I say ""used to"" because I figured out that in order to remedy this, all you really have to do is give it a slightly-more-than-firm push into the section and it will stay in place. Another quick one about this pen that is purely cosmetic: The feed has some bent wings on its underside. The pen arrived like this, and these do not impact performance as far as I'm aware of, but they do look a bit odd. They could easily be bent back into place, I just don't mind that much as it's barely noticeable. **Priced for $18 plus shipping.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Next is the gray Wing Sung 601-A (2020 version, C+) with a generously named ""fine"" nib.** This one is super great. It holds a ton of ink, feels solid in the hand despite its light weight (excellent for long note-taking IMO), and writes very smoothly. The problem with this one is that it likes to skip at times and blob at others. I'm not sure entirely what could be causing this, but cleaning out the pen and carefully examining the nib/feed yielded no results for me. I'm sure that it isn't a hard fix, I just don't know exactly what could be causing it. The nib is **wonderfully smooth**, but is much closer to a medium than a fine. Compared to my Platinum #3776 Century Medium it is just a smidge broader. **Priced for $12 plus shipping. (NOTE: DOES NOT INCLUDE SILICONE GREASE/WRENCH/ORIGINAL PACKAGING BECAUSE I COULDN'T FIND THEM.)**

&amp;#x200B;

**Finally I have a black Wing Sung 601-A (2019 version, B+) with a fine conical nib.** Every aspect of this pen is as good as the gray one if not better, with the one (rather important) exception of the nib. For whatever reason I *cannot* get this pen to write smoothly. Trust me, this isn't just ""tooth"" or ""feedback"", the pen genuinely feels like it's grinding into the paper. It isn't so sharp that it cuts paper, and it does write a consistent line, but as far as I can tell the nib has almost no tipping material. Because of this I didn't attempt to smooth it at all, as I didn't want to remove what little there was already there, but if you are more confident in your tuning abilities than me (or you just want something inexpensive to practice on), this is the pen for you. This particular pen also features a modern conical nib, which I find quite aesthetically pleasing, being a fan of Sheaffer's vintage triumph nibs. I just wish the darned thing was smooth. The rest of the pen, like I mentioned before, is absolutely impeccable. The piston is smoother than the gray one for some reason (I did take apart and re-grease each of them prior to recording them, which is why the gray one sounds like it's mushy... it had a little water left in it), and the body of the pen is just a tad longer which makes it fit ever-so-slightly better in my hand. **Priced for $13 plus shipping, including original packaging and all the goodies inside (even the manual that's in Mandarin!).**

&amp;#x200B;

**But wait, there's more! Before you click off this post, dear pen person, I have an** ***offer*** **to make you! All three of these pens can be yours for the low price of $30 shipped. Not only does this save you money on all three pens, it also means that they will be shipped together, so they'll arrive at your doorstep all together! (Triple pen days are three times as fun!)**

I hope y'all are having a great day so far. I am trying to collect every color, excluding limited runs though I am not opposed to having them, in the Pilot Irozhizuku line. I love the way the ink behaves and the colors are really something else. I will list the inks below that I am still looking for. 

I am also open to any decent offers for inks that do not feather much and are similarly well-behaved to Pilot or Watermans inks.

* Take-Sumi
* Tsukushi
* Ama-Iro
* Chiku-Rin
* Ina-Ho
* Kiri-Same
* Kosumosu
* Ku-Jake
* Murasaki-Shikibu
* Shin-Kai
* Tskuki-yo
* Tsuyu-Kusa
* Yama-Budo
* Yama-Guri

Ideally, I would like to buy these in as few transactions as possible but I am sure this won't happen. I'm fine with 50mL or 15mL so long as the price is reflects the change in volume. 

The other item I am looking for is one more Narwhal in an F nib. I don't care what color so long as the nib is a size F. My first pick would be a Peter Draws exclusive but any of the Narwhal Originals would be great, so long as they're interesting colors.

I've had this lovely M800 for just over a month now. I was initially planning on using it at work as an EDC, but it's just too nice for me to wave around in a hospital. 

It's got a few of what might be described micro scratches in keeping with being used for a month. 

The nib is a fine nib that initially came with a Baby's bottom and was far too wet. I've had it sent to The Pen Doctor, who reground it to a reasonable Fine-Medium and got rid of the baby's bottom. There's a bit of pleasant feedback, but no more hard starts or skips etc. 

I've got the original faux leather envelope, box and documentation.

The pens:

* [SOLD] ~~Jinhao x750 stainless steel &lt;M&gt; - pen is in great shape, only minor scuffs that are hard to see through the brushed stainless finish. Writes great, rated \[B\] - $5~~
* [SOLD] ~~Jinhao x450 blue ice &lt;M&gt; - This one's had a nib swap, juicy writer probably closer to a &lt;B&gt;, but otherwise great shape. Rating \[D\] for nib swap - $4~~
* [SOLD]~~Jinhao 950 shrimp &lt;M&gt; - Inked once, mostly sat in a drawer. I like how it looks but never really used it. Rating \[B\] - $4~~
* [SOLD] ~~Jinhao 950 bamboo &lt;M&gt; - Also inked once. Had some performance issues but I recently discovered all it needed was a simple nib alignment and it's working fine now. Rating \[B\] - $4~~
* [SOLD]~~Noodler's Charlie pen - freebie eyedropper that came with my big bottle of Heart of Darkness. It still has that funny smell that these pens are known for. I think this pen works but it's been a long time since it's had any ink in it, so I'm rating \[D\] to be safe. Free to the first person to ask for it.~~

The inks - all of the below are 95% full or more. Most have had 1-2 fills taken from them and are closer to 99%.

EDIT: Down to my last 3 inks, let's do $17 shipped for all three. 

* Noodler's Cayenne - ~~$9~~

SOLD - **Montblanc 221 - Red - EF Nib - Condition is C - Price $110**

The pen is a piston filler. There is no ink window on this model. The extra fine is very fine. I'm left-handed and I find it to be a bit scrachy. But I had a right-handed person try it out and they didn't run into the issues I did. I tried to write right-handed and found it smooth. It's an old pen and I'm not the first owner, so it's being rated C.

This is the ""homage"" to the Pilot Custom 823. It's a pretty nice pen and the nib work is great. I purchased a Pilot 823 a month or so back, and it's basically killed this pen for me. Rating is D for nib work. I've priced it for the pen and nib work.

SOLD - **Desiderata Dunka 2020 - Matte Black Ebonite - EF Jowo Steel - Condition is B - Price $270**

This pen is great, but I've found it to be a tad thick for my hand. It's a piston-filler and works very well. I'll probably consider purchasing one of his other pens with smaller diameter in the future as this pen is top notch quality. Pierre really knows what he is doing and it shows.

I just don't use it as much as I wish I did. You can see this pen on Atelier Lusso's Instagram if you look for April 27, 2020. The condition is probably more like A2 but I put B to be sure.

This is a gorgeous pen - but I'm over my collection limit, so it needs a new home. It's a 1940's era sheaffer triumph lifetime, with the white dot and extra wide cap band. Very conservative D rating for a mark on the cap (visible in the timestamp photo) and microscratching. Otherwise in excellent condition with great barrel transparency.

The nib is a classic conical triumph nib with a slight upturn. It's very firm, extra-fine, with moderate wetness and slight feedback normal for an EF nib.

I've restored the plunger mechanism using Dave Nishimura's method. It now has a modern rubber gasket seal at the back end, fresh plunger gasket, and lubricated with silicone grease. It fills to over 50% barrel capacity with one stroke of the plunger and will get to 75% full with two strokes.

**Condition (n.b.):** All pens listed below have been disassembled, cleaned and restored with new sacs installed in the lever fillers and threads greased on the eyedropper in the last couple weeks. *Each of these pens is guaranteed to fill and write as designed without leaks or other problems. Nibs have been adjusted when necessary to ensure that all lay down a smooth and consistent line.*

**THESE PENS HAVE NO CRACKS, CHIPS, PERSONALIZATIONS (except #4), LOOSE OR MISSING PARTS, BENT NIBS, MISALIGNED TINES, BROKEN/EXCESSIVELY WORN TIPPING, OR THREADING ISSUES.**

&amp;nbsp;

**Line Widths and Writing Samples:** To provide buyers with as much information as possible, I have started to adopt the following line width standards: XXF (.1-.2mm); XF (approx .3mm); F (approx .4mm); M (approx .6mm); B (approx .8mm). Nib flexibility is determined by variation (max line width under pressure) and softness (amount of pressure). Flexibility designations based on variation generally run as follows for an XF/F nib: Semi-Flex (approx. 1mm); Flex (1.2-1.9mm);  Superflex (&gt;2mm). All line width measurements are taken with a digital caliper but should be considered approximations providing a general guide. Width may vary slightly depending on type of ink and paper used as well as amount of pressure applied. All writing samples are on Rhodia dot paper using Waterman Serenity Blue.

&amp;nbsp;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;nbsp;

~~**1. 1918-22 Moore L-92** (BCHR, GFT, lever filler, 14k XF Superflex nib). Measures 5 3/8"" capped). Moore was an early first-tier pen company out of Boston that never managed to garner the popular acclaim of The Big Four brands. In spite of this, their quality of construction was on a par with those makers. In addition to this, their innovative lever filler design and expressive, long-tined nibs have made them sought after by a loyal following of writers and collectors. This pen, marked L-92 on the barrel end (see album shot) is made of black chased hard rubber complemented by gold-filled trim including a wide cap band engraved in a checkerboard pattern with cartouche for engraving. This pen came clipless from the factory (no holes drilled for a clip) during a time when this was standard. Super-Flexible 14k Moore #2 nib lays down a smooth and consistent XF line that widens to a 4B+ (approx 2.1mm) under light pressure (see [WRITING SAMPLE](https://imgur.com/FgZerjJ)). Thin hairlines, responsive snap-back, and consistent flow over its full range of flex make it great choice for calligraphic writing styles such as Copperplate and Spencerian. **Condition:** near mint [B+]. With the exception of the Parker below, which includes its original factory box, they don't come much nicer than this. Hard rubber retains its factory black color with virtually no fading. Chasing is factory sharp and crisp. Surface is smooth and lustrous with no deep scratches or other notable blemishes. Gold-filled trim is pristine, showing no brassing or other noteworthy flaws. Cartouche on cap band has been left blank. Manufacturer imprint on the barrel and number stamp on barrel end are factory deep. (Note that the pen was set crooked in the tray in a couple of photos – there is no actual crookedness in how the cap sits or anything like that) Price: $260~~ **SOLD**

&amp;nbsp;

~~**2. 1907-1910 Parker 42 1/2 Eyedropper in Factory Box** (BCHR, GFT, lever filler, 14k XXF Needlepoint Superflex nib). Measures 5 1/2"" capped. Now and then I stumble upon a pen befitting of a museum exhibit. This is one of those pens. The 42 1/2 was introduced by George S. Parker less than 10 years after he founded the company in 1888. It was a luxury model at the time. Overlaying its black chased hard rubber body are a heavy gold-filled barrel band and cap crown, hand-engraved using the repoussé technique – working from the underside to create a high relief exterior. The cap crown of this pen exhibits a snail pattern while a floral pattern adorns the barrel band, interrupted by a blank cartouche for engraving. The exquisite details are quite a sight to behold in person. The 42 1/2 is a rare pen – a term I don't use loosely. And to find one with its original nib and feed intact, let alone one in its original factory box is no mean task (see [DETAIL PHOTO](https://imgur.com/37iWvfn) and photo of box interior in album). The nib is a correct #3 keyhole and the feed is a correct long-tailed lucky curve spearhead (introduced in 1903) (see [DETAIL PHOTO](https://imgur.com/sxm4qHa)). Meanwhile, the box is of the early sort: wood construction with velvet-lined interior. The 42 1/2 came clipless from the factory (no holes drilled for a clip) during a time when this was standard. It has an eyedropper filling system: section unscrews for the barrel to be filled with ink using an eyedropper/pipette. Holds far more ink than a lever filler of the same size. Since the nib itself is so difficult to come by, I handled it *conservatively* in taking the writing sample, not wanting to push it anywhere close to its limit. In so doing, I found it to lay down a smooth and consistent XXF line that widens to a 3B+ (approx 1.8mm) under light pressure (see [WRITING SAMPLE](https://imgur.com/nqb5IAt)). Owing to its softness, my conservative handling, and the stark variation between the flexed line and the unflexed XXF line, I've graded this nib as Super-Flexible. Needlepoint hairlines, wondrously responsive snap-back (more so than any other in the batch), and reliable flow over its full range of flex make it an ideal choice for calligraphic writing styles such as Copperplate and Spencerian, the latter being still in fashion when the pen was originally sold. **Condition:** near mint [B+]. Not merely collector- but musuam-grade condition. Hard rubber retains its factory black color with no discernible fading. Chasing is factory sharp and crisp with no discernible wear. Surface is smooth and lustrous with no notable scratches or other blemishes. Gold-filled trim is virtually pristine, showing no brassing or other noteworthy issues aside from a bit of verdigris in a couple of the deeper recesses of the overlay. Cartouche for engraving has been left blank. Manufacturer imprint on the barrel and number stamp on barrel end are factory deep. The box shows wear commensurate with age and tape was applied to the back at some point to reinforce it where the hinge has failed. A time capsule pen and an early Parker icon. Price: $420~~ **[SOLD to a local friend]**

&amp;nbsp;

~~**3. late-1920s Wahl-Eversharp 72 Greek Key** (BCHR, Greek Key pattern, GFT, lever filler, 14k XF Flex/Superflex nib). This is the full-length, standard girth model, measuring 5 3/16"" capped. Before Wahl introduced its Gold Seal pens in the late 1920s, the company manufactured some stunning flat tops exemplified by this one. It's made of black hard rubber, chased in the geometric Art Deco design referred to by collectors as Greek Key or Grecian Border. Generous gold-filled hardware includes 3 cap rings on the cap and functional roller clip (a design Wahl acquired from the Boston pen company in the 1910s). This model bears ""Wahl-Eversharp"" imprints on both cap and nib and lacks the '72' stamp on the barrel-end, leading me to believe it's a later model, perhaps even contemporaneous with early Gold Seal pens when W-E had abandoned its earlier numbering system. 14k Wahl-Eversharp nib is marked Flexible, which is about right on my scale with regard to variation while softness verges on Super-Flexible. It lays down a smooth and consistent XF line that widens to a 3B+ (approx 1.8mm) under very light to moderate pressure (see [WRITING SAMPLE](https://imgur.com/pAbcIqo)). Thin hairlines, strong snap-back, and consistent flow over its full range of flex make it great choice for expressive and calligraphic writing styles. **Condition:** excellent [B]. Hard rubber has retained much of its color, appearing black in most lighting conditions but with a tinge of deep, dark brown in direct sunlight. Chasing is weaker than new but still visible and palpable. Surface is smooth and lustrous with no deep scratches or other notable blemishes. Gold-filled trim shows no brassing aside from tiny spots on the apex of the lever visible under a loupe and no other noteworthy flaws aside from a couple light scratches on the lever. Manufacturer imprint on the cap shows moderate wear but is still fully legible when the light strikes it. Price: $210~~ **SOLD**

&amp;nbsp;

~~**4. 1915-20s Aikin Lambert Capitol Cabinet** (BCHR, NPT, lever filler, 14k F Superflex Factory Stub nib). Measures 5 3/8"" capped. Aikin Lambert manufactured nibs for various makers including Waterman and made a handful of pens of their own before LE Waterman purchased the company in 1915. This Capitol Cabinet in black chased hard rubber resembles a Waterman 52 in most respects except for trim. The nickel-plated lever is a simpler, boxless design while the clip has an elegant teardrop profile. 14k ALCO (Aikin Lambert Company) nib is a Super-Flexible Factory Stub – a personal favorite of mine! Unflexed, it lays down a smooth and consistent F line on the down-strokes and XF line on the cross-strokes. Under light pressure, that line widens to a 4B+ (approx 2.0mm) – see [WRITING SAMPLE](https://imgur.com/51yTvI8). A versatile nib well suited to adding flair to everyday note-taking as it is to adding variation to calligraphic writing styles while keeping the letterforms neat and straight. **Condition:** excellent/fair [B/C]. If the hard rubber were the only consideration, I'd grade this pen as near mint. Hard rubber retains its factory black color with no discernible fading. Chasing is factory sharp and crisp with no discernible wear. And the manufacturer imprint on the barrel is factory deep. Nickel-plated trim is clean aside from a cluster of scratches in the middle of the pen's clip. Surface is smooth and lustrous with no notable scratches or anything else of note aside from a curious heatstamp on the side of the barrel that reads 'M-22' (see timestamp photo). At first I thought this might be a factory prototype number of some sort, but the overwhelming majority of Google hits for 'M-22' pertain to the scenic highway (est. 1915) that runs along the shoreline of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. So perhaps this was a commemorative pen or else was personalized for a business or government agency operating there? A thought-provoking echo of the past for those who dig imprints like me; an inconspicuous mark that blends into the barrel chasing for those who don't.  Price: $240~~ **SOLD**

**~~Moonman T1 \[B\]:~~** Bought from another pen\_swap user over a year ago and have dipped it once in Pilot Iroshizuku Ku-Jaku (a perfect ink match for it, if you're into that). It's a very firm and smooth writer from what I recall. I think technically the nib is a Western F but felt more like an M to me. Great condition, just haven't reached for it. **~~$18 + shipping~~** **SOLD**

**Muji fountain pen \[A2\]:** F nib with decent amount of feedback and spring to it. Inked once with Pilot Iroshizuku Murasaki-Shikibu. I really wanted to like this pen, but the writing experience just doesn't suit me. I'm including a converter with this pen (it doesn't come with one when sold new). **$15 + shipping**

**Hero 616 \[B\]:** F? nib. This pen is a Parker 51 clone that I bought to see if I'd like sac fillers; turns out I don't. The hooded nib is firm, smooth, and has good flow. Inked twice with Diamine Green Umber; very slight staining in the sac. I'd prefer to include this one as an add-on for **$1**.

**Current status:** I am finding that the greatest challenge of this work is in getting to the post office to ship out completed pens. That said, I’ve shipped out a number this past week and thus have cleared my bandwidth for new work. Having said that, I feel it is wise to increase my standard turnaround time to **two weeks**, plus shipping time.

I’ve done some tuning for several fellow redditors, including u/ciggybuttboi, u/bpov2012, u/MFahim, u/ChromaLife, u/torsion12, and u/Grumpyoldman79, among others, who have been pleased with my work.

Check out this testimonial from u/torsion12: “I had dropped a Sailor several inches nib-first onto a metal desktop; the nib wasn’t totally destroyed but it certainly wasn’t writing like a Sailor should. Stephen made it as good as new. Highly, highly recommended.”

Full service costs **$20 per nib, plus shipping both ways**, and includes any or all of the following:

—Improving ink flow. Dryness, skipping, hard starts, etc.

—Curing baby’s bottom.

—Smoothing scratchy nibs.

—Aligning misaligned nib tines.

**Fine print** (please read): Satisfaction guaranteed or your money back. I will guarantee a pen’s value UP TO $50 in the unlikely event that I damage your pen as a result of my service. PLEASE DO NOT SEND PENS VALUED HIGHER THAN THAT if you do not accept the risk over and above that amount. Service will take approximately two weeks plus shipping time. If I’m unable to fix your nib, you will receive a full refund. CONUS only at this time. NOTE: please be sure you want to follow through before you pay my invoice. I reserve the right to refuse “changed my mind” refunds.

Here’s the way I work. I am based on the east coast. If you want to send me pens to tune, and complete pens are preferred, you give me your PayPal email. I invoice you $20 per pen plus $5 return ship or $10 priority if preferred (I.e., $25 or $30 for one pen, $45 or $50 for two, etc). PRIORITY RETURN SHIP IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Once you pay, I give you my mailing address and you ship the pen.

I got these pens in a bundle of pens from Japan, from a seller who had closed his stationery store and was selling off his old inventory.  Unfortunately, sometimes you have to buy a whole bundle just to get the 1 or 2 pens you really want.  So catch and release!  The original seller indicated that these specific pens were NOS, unused, and never inked, so the condition should really be \[N\], but to be conservative I put it as \[B\] due to the age.

&amp;#x200B;

Pen 1:  **\[B\] Sailor pink long/short, 14K fine nib.  $40 plus shipping as detailed below.**

Dimensions are about 10.5 cm capped, \~14.2 cm posted, \~6 g empty.  Cap is probably aluminum, with a stainless steel folded clip, the body is pink plastic. Date code on the pen is listed as ""gl"", which indicates manufacturing date of Dec 1964.  There is slight dust and very slight discoloration under the clip, but it's really minor for a 56 year old pen.  

&amp;#x200B;

Pen 2:  **\[B\] Sailor white long/short, 14K fine nib.  $40 plus shipping as detailed below.**

Dimensions about 11.2 cm capped, \~13.5 cm posted, \~6 g empty.  Cap is probably aluminum, with a gold-colored clip, the body is white plastic.  It comes with a 14k fine nib.  Date code is 109, which indicates manufacturing date of Sept 1971.  Near the bottom of the white body does appear to have some sticker residue or something, which may or may not come off, but I left the pen just as I received it.  

&amp;#x200B;

These pens are good for someone with smaller hands, who may like thinner/lighter pens.  The pens are best used posted, as that increases the overall in-hand length, hence ""long/short"".  In case anyone is curious, I haven't tried these specific pens, but I have several Sailor long/shorts and several Pilot Elite long/shorts, and I actually prefer the Sailors to the Pilots, because I found the Sailors to be smoother writing than the Pilots.  But nibs are always a matter of preference.  And again, these current pens are uninked, so I don't have any writing samples for them.

I will include **2 sailor cartridges with each pen**, your choice of any combination of the following, conditional upon supply:  Sailor Blue, Blue-Black, Black, Seiboku (blue/back pigment), or Kiwaguro (black pigment).  Since these are long/shorts, so far I've only used the Sailor cartridges with them.  It's possible the Sailor mini-converters MIGHT fit, but I've never tried it, so I have no idea.  Regular Sailor converters will NOT fit.

Pens will be shipped in the Continental US, in a pen tube I got from [Penrealm.com](https://Penrealm.com), in a padded envelope, for **$5 by First Class shipping**.  If you prefer priority shipping, or a box, then it will be $8.

This is a great way to dip your feet into gold nibs!  These are fingernail type nibs though, so they are hard/firm nibs.  Don't expect ""vintage flex"" to apply.",[WTS] Vintage 60's/70's Sailor Long/short pocket pens NOS

**Asking Price: ~~$300~~ $250**

#**Sheaffer Snorkel Sentinel, Chrome Cap, White Dot, Fully Restored [D]**

 &gt; Excellent writer, used daily for quite a while though it really doesn't show it. Rated D for non-original parts, but works perfectly.

**Asking Price: ~~$180~~ $130**

#**Wahl Eversharp Skyline Set [D]**

 &gt; Recently had it tuned and realigned by Mark Bacas. Great writer, but too small for my hands. Rating due to tuning and the fact that most vintage pens have been re-saced at some point in their lives.

**Asking Price: ~~$200~~ $180**

#**Conklin Ringtop Crescent Filler [D]**

 &gt; Really small pen, approx. 4 inches capped and 7 posted. Unlike modern crescents, the lock ring only turns a little bit, not a full 180. Nib is a size #2. Body is Black Hard Rubber with a Chased pattern. Imprint is a bit worn, but legible. Brand new 100% silicone sac installed by yours truly. Little to no oxidization of the BHR leads me to believe a previous owner may have deoxidized it. Writing Sample: https://imgur.com/RrGjAC7

 **Asking Price: ~~$125~~ $110**

#**Parker Duofold, Senior Flat-top, Lapis [D]**

&gt; Awesome pen, one of the greats from the 1920's era. Cap threading is a little wonky, but it still screws on securely. Some brassing as is typical of vintage pens. Fully working.

**Asking Price: ~~$400~~ $350**

#**Parker Duofold Deluxe, Senior Flat-top, Black [D]**

&gt; Really nice pen, fully working. Recently Restored. Only flaw is a bit of brassing on the band.

**Asking Price: ~~$350~~ $300**

#**Sheaffer Balance [D]**

&gt; Good workhorse pen for those who like thin pens. Not too much thicker than a pencil. Lever Filler. Fully restored by yours truly.

**Asking Price: ~~$100~~ $75**

#**Parker Duofold, Streamlined Juniorette, Jade [D]**

I've had this pen in my collection for about 10 years but it was used very sparingly, so time to let someone else enjoy this beast. Ink window is clear with no stains. piston works great. Montblanc service folks replaced the original feed with a modern feed in 2012. I don't have a lot of history on reddit, but check me out on Fountainpennetwork under tenurepro.

I won this pen in a sales contest back in '99 or so when I worked for a pen store.   It's had plenty of use and held up great over the years.   I took some close-up pictures so you can see some of the micro-scratching for full disclosure, but that is super-detailed.   To the naked eye it still looks incredibly stunning without any major flaws or anything like that.   Definitely an eye-catcher even if it's only a rollerball.  :)  


I'm selling this only to fund another ""Grail"" pen purchase;  otherwise it's a great pen and good workhorse EDC.

At some point I thought that I would need ballpoints and rollerballs when fountain pens wouldnt work and I do, but I've started using other ballpoints and rollerballs and have forgotten all about these guys. 

1. First set here is the highlight of this group, the first grouping here is a Cross Century Rollerball and Ballpoint set.  The pens are chrome and have lines on the body and cap.  On the top of the pens youll see the CROSS labelling and youll see the MADE IN USA stamp.  These guys are the real deal and not the ones made in China which are inferior in quality (both in action and in plating).  The pens dont have plating loss and come with the original packaging, it is a handsome set for anyone.  The rollerball is new and the rubber tip is still on the refill and the ballpoint writes and this set will come with a ballpoint refill.  Refills are plentiful and you can even replace the rollerball with a felt tip. - $30 B conservative rating for sitting in the box.

2. The second set here, is a set that does not match perfectly, while they are both chrome plated and lined, the pencil also has some knurling at the grip area.  Moreover the pencil has the MADE IN USA labelling on the top while the ballpoint pen does not have the MADE IN USA.  I would say that either this set is mismatched or it was made during the period when CROSS first started moving their work overseas.  Ive looked over the set and there is no plating loss on these guys and they both work well. This is a handsome set as well and would make a great little gift for yourself or someone you like. - $25 B conservative rating for sitting in the box

3. Cross modern repair Century Ballpoint and Pencil Set  - So I sent a vintage pen set out for CROSS to repair as part of their program and in a somewhat annoying turn of events they sent back two pens that are NEW and MODERN Cross pens.  These pens as I have stated are not as smooth as the vintage ones and are lighter in the hand.  While I am happy that they are both working now, I am not so happy that its basically a replacement and not a repair.  The caps have the CROSS marking on them and the modern Cross ICON and cross on it. These are NEW pens and they MSRP for more and you can be sure that these are not counterfeit as they are from Cross themselves - $35 - new sent from Cross, so A

For sale here is a user-grade Eversharp Skyline with a semi-flex 14k fine point nib. Body is green, and the cap green-gold striped. Condition Rating is a D. Body has some scratches and some brassing on the lever &amp; clip. But it has no personalizations, no cracks, and no huge scratches or dents.

Nib is a nice smooth 14k fine point that with some moderate pressure can yield to an appreciable amount of line variation. Though modest, the flexibility is very much controllable, and definitely more than one usually sees on a Skyline.

I have never eyedroppered it so the body is clean and does not have ink residue in it.  The pen has no markings on it although there maybe microscratching from use and sitting.

When these pens were first made, they were meant to replace the lever fillers with their first converter system which is a switch inside of a metal sheath with a sac inside of it.  

The nib on this guys is a smooth and reliable Pilot FINE SCRIPT NIB.  These script nibs feature a nail like writing experience with a thick piece of gold.  You can see the thick gold from the sides of the nib and is very cool. 

The filling system came to me damaged and Ive since replaced the sac with a silicone sac which will hold the same amount of ink as the orignal but should be able to take a wider range of inks with no issue.  Just press the switch at the end with the nib in the bottle and itll take up the ink.  If you hate it you can take the metal sheath off and then fill it like a squeeze filler but it works well as it is now. 

The pen is in great condition for its age with minimal plating loss near the bottom cap, but its almost fully intact on the cap and clip. The plastic that it is made of is also robust and has no deep scratches on it.  this particular model is not in the lower range of the SUPER pens, with the cheaper light caps and the smaller nibs, this is the mid-range super pen.  Not as high end as the inlaid nibs but one step before that.

For sale here is a user-grade lever-fill Sheaffer Balance 500 Admiral in Green with Military Clip. Body is in good shape overall: no personalizations, no huge marks, no cracks, just the usual signs of use one would expect for a pen of this vintage. The military clip itself is usable but just a tad loose. Clip and lever has some brassing. Condition rating is a very conservative D.

The cosmetics notwitstanding, the star of this pen is the nib: a #5 fine point 14k Feathertouch nib. The nib is smooth, as one would expect from a Sheaffer. And with some pressure applied, the nib can actually eke out some line variation. The ink storage components--the lever mechanism and ink sac--work well and as designed. I bought this about a year ago from Peyton St Pens refurbished. So you can basically trust that this as is has many more years in service left in it.

Here for sale today is a little a little bit of a mystery pen because of the design, the nib, materials, and imprint.  This Conklin is a later model Conklin after they were bought out in the 1940s and had their operations moved to Chicago.  The imprinting on the pen shows as much and the design of the pen kind of indicates that as well.  The design of the pen itself is similar to a Glider, and the imprinting kind of indicates that it wouldve been made at around the same time period.  

During this switch over there were many pens that were made that used higher quality pen parts from the original Conklin company, such as the nibs and with poorer quality materials like the inferior plating.  This pen is a good example of that, youll find that the plating is failing a little on the clip and there is a mark on the band itself (might be a marker but Im not sure).  All that being said there are some marks on this pen on the clip and band so I would mark it a D conservatively.

The highlights are that this beautiful clear celluloid that you can kind of see transparency in some of the red material, which is mesmerizing. The imprint is strong as you can tell from the marking.  The section is still clear and you can see the ink if you move it around to see when you need to refill the pen.  Finally the nib is the best part of this pen, the nib is a 14K Fine Toledo nib.  These nibs are a product of the original Conklin company and are made extremely well, the nib is a Soft Fine nib so it has some bounce to it when you write.  As with all of these softer nibs, it feels great on the page and has some give to it.  I would NOT flex this nib because its not really made for it but it is not a modern day NAIL type nib.

**AURORA**

For sale today is a Black and Gold Aurora Duo Cart with a really nice flexible nib. This guys is a really cool pen, a vintage Aurora Duo Cart, these guys are hard to find and see in the United States. These pens were robust and beautiful and are a real rival to the Parker 51 in terms of use and design.  

The original pen had these two mini carts that were inside of the pen that you could use and they were made to compete in the same market as the 51/61.  At the end of the barrel there is a chain with a metal to know that you need to refill the filling mechanism.  I have placed a rubber piece that can be taken out to keep the ball in place so you don't hear it, you can shake that piece out if you want to feel the ball mechanism move. The pen will come with a platinum converter so that you can use it, strangely enough these converters will fit for this pen and they work very well for the pen.  The converter in gold also matches the pen quite handsomely. 

As you can see the pen is in great condition however it has microscratches and a few marks on the cap which is expected from the age of the pen. There are two noticeable marks on the cap for me but theyre not massive but you see them on the cap, so it is a C. 

The nib here is the real feature, the Duocart like the 88 came with three different kinds of flexibility and this one is a flex nib, the others are semi and firm.  This nib can flex from a nice EF that is a true EF all the way up to a B sizing.  The nib springs back correctly and feels good in the hand.  As with all vintage auroras there is feedback but with a nib this fine, I think it is inevitable.  Check out the writing sample, although my handwriting is terrible, there is a nice example of what you can do with the flex going down a page and also in quick writing. 

The cap in this case is also a pull cap, and the pen can be posted.

The nibs on these guys are both Western Fine sized and they feature gold plated hooded nibs which compliment the gold trim and the wood. The caps on these guys are pull caps like most pens in this design. The design on these pens are really interesting, unlike some other wooden bodied pens, it features a little wooden ring on the section so when youre writing you can still feel the wood and its not a slippery plastic section. The nibs on these pens are smooth and reliable, moreso than some Wing Sung nibs of the same design (but it is wider because I use EF wing sung nibs).  I have left one inked on my desk for two weeks without use and it starts right up after writing.  I am honestly very surprised it didnt dry out or at least give me a hard start. 

The lighter brown one is in A2 condition and I used the pen to test but it has sat on my table.  The dark brown one in ebony finish is in New condition as it has not been used or ink. Either of these two pens would be a great gift or just a nice wooden fountain pen for your collection.

There is a THIRD darker wood one is UNUSED however I noticed that there is a crack in the wood section and a scratch on the barrel. The wood section here is glued to a brass converter area and will not leak ink however it was a serious issue. This one was going to be a return however they just sent a new one.  These issues are mainly cosmetic and they SHOULD not leak and might be a throw around pen or a pen that you can use for parts.  The cap itself is fairly high quality and has some weight, the nib is reliable and smooth.  I would consider this a free pen that comes along with the other two.

**Sailor Jentle 'Yamadori'** (50mL) - 95% Gorgeous Sailor ink that sheens like crazy. Reminds me of EoC without the nasty shimmer. This now only comes in the small 20mL bottles, but you can have a lot more of it here!


**Krishna 'Paakezah' Blue** (30mL) - 99% If Yamadori sheens like crazy, Paakezah is certifiably and clinically sheen insane. No, sorry, you don't get THAT glass bottle with this ink, but it does come in a regular glass bottle for your shipping satisfaction.


**DeAtramentis Document Ink 'Fog Grey'** (45mL) - 95% Nice muted blue. It says it's grey, but it's blue, which is like grey, but better! This is pigmented ink and very water resistant.

**DeAtramentis Document Ink 'Dark Red'** (45mL) - 95% Lovely dark, rusty red. The bottle says '35mL', but I'm almost positive it's actually 45. This is pigmented ink and very water resistant.

**KWZ Ink 'I.G. Green #4'** (60mL) - 95% Nice dark, forest green. This is an iron gall ink, plus it smells like vanilla.

**Diamine 'Red Dragon'** (30mL) - 90% A really beautiful, deep red. It even sheens on occasion. If you have a dry-writing pen, this is the ink to get it flowing.

This pen is a great writer-a typical smooth and wet Pelikan nib. I have not carried this pen, only just inked and used it at my desk, so it shows no signs of carrying.

Hey all, today I'm trying to get rid of my Schon Design Faceted Pocket Six. It's in a silver anodized aluminum and has a #6 Jowo 1.1 mm stub nib. Great pen, but as soon as I picked it up I knew it was too light for me. I gave it a shot anyway, so it's been inked with some Diamine Prussian Blue, but I've not actually carried it, and I've written very little. Takes International Short cartridges (of which a relatively new one is installed) and comes with original packaging and a Schon DSGN pocket notebook. These retail for $260, asking **@245** OBO for my short time with it.

This is a straight catch-and-release from the excellent u/popcodswallop's restored vintage stash; original post with all the full details [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pen_Swap/comments/moz43a/wts_vintage_colorful_ringtops_with_flex_nibs/).

To quote their words:

&gt;**1920s National Ring Top** (pastel blue, celluloid, GPT, lever filler, 14k XF Flex nib). Measures 4 1/2"" capped and 5 3/4"" posted. This pen lacks a maker's mark but has a lever identical to the Diamond Medal's above. In the writing sample I tentatively identified it as a Diamond Medal, but I think it'd be more accurate to attribute it to National, the maker of DM pens (i.e. the brand rather than the DM sub-brand). For more on the National Pen Products company, see #3 above. This pen is made of celluloid in a sort of robin egg's blue color complemented by gold-plated trim. Flexible 14k Warranted #3 nib lays down a smooth and consistent XF line that widens to a 3B+ (approx 1.8mm) under moderate pressure (see [WRITING SAMPLE](https://imgur.com/hR0bx53)). Thin hairlines, strong snap-back, and reliable flow over its full range of flex make it a great choice for expressive writing styles. **Condition:** excellent \[B\]. Gold-plated hardware is clean aside from a shadow of wear around the bottom of the cap band. Celluloid surface is smooth and lustrous with no deep scratches or other significant blemishes.

It's a lovely pen, and great writer, but a more muted color in person than I was expecting, and thus a bit redundant with an existing vintage flex pen I have. Pen color in verification image &amp; new writing sample is true to life.

2. Rugged Minimalist A5 Journal Cover. I ordered the hand-stitched version for $130 on their Etsy shop and had to wait a month. It’s a great little cover. Ethereal are some signs of wear inside and a scrape along the back (i don’t know if it came that way or i made it like that); the price reflects that wear. I’d give it a C+ rating. Price here was $80, now $70 shipped. No wait, and it’s already broken in a bit! Objects in the cover are not included. 

3. Noodler’s Apache Sunset about 95% full. I’d like to add this one in on one of the above for $8. If you’d like to buy separately, the price is $10 shipped. 

Trade:

I have a TWSBI 580 ALR Punch Pink [A2–inked once and cleaned before finishing the fill]. I’d like to trade the for a similar condition 580 ALR Prussian Blue. Mine is a fine nib; I’d like to trade for one with a F or EF.

I recently acquired a second Grimsmo Saga. As with most people, I have determined that I am absolutely not coordinated enough to write with two hands at the same time, so now having two feels redundant and one has to go. \\\#641 here has volunteered for the task, so here we are.

The Saga is a hell of a pen, and this is a great example of a Saga. The mechanism is crisp, smooth, and absolutely fidgety. The stonewash is absolutely preem, and feels great in hand. There's the tiiiiniest bit of patina forming on the slider, and it really just makes that section of the pen pop a bit more.

Condition: \[D\].

The mix on the Primary Manipulation rod used for the barrel isn't my favorite -- it has a lot of beautiful detail and drama, but I prefer something more serene and consistent from end to end. Which is too bad, because [the cap on this one has a truly remarkable gentle mix of blues and pinks](https://imgur.com/XiyMCyE) that reminds me of a Georgia O'Keeffe painting.

\[Imgur\]([https://imgur.com/ni8RF5u](https://imgur.com/ni8RF5u))

This is a Montblanc 3-42G. To ""decode"" the model a bit, ""3"" designates a 3rd line pen, 4 indicates piston filler, 2 indicates the size, and ""G"" means gold nib. This is a petite pen, about the same diameter as a Parker 51 but shorter. This is probably a 1950s pen.

This pen was sold to me as recently restored with fresh cork seals in the piston. The piston operates correctly and provides a full fill of ink. Note that this is not a ""telescopic"" piston as found on the 14x models of this vintage.

The turning knob is marked ""F"" to indicate a fine nib. With no pressure, the monotone 14K nib writes like a true vintage fine, and probably on par with a modern Japanese fine or a modern western EF.

I'd call this a semi-flex nib. It will flex out to roughly a BB size, but requires intentional pressure to do so. The verification photo shows some lines and scribbles made with this nib.

This pen is in overall nice condition, and has the attractive Montblanc ""mountain"" logo on the side of the cap in addition to the cap.

Baoer 801 - B, inked twice ($5)

Visconti - B, wear on the barrel because of the way the cap posts ($150)

Diamine Green/Black - almost completely full, mixed with vanness white lightning (Free with either purchase)

The Baoer 801 is a good pen, but I need to cull my collection. I enjoy my preppy a bit more so I'm going to get rid of the Baoer. It writes perfectly fine.

The Visconti was disappointing. The medium nib is basically a broad and the fine nib is a medium. It's a really nice pen, but for $50 i can get a FPR with a flex nib instead of a basic, no-flair Bock. So, I'm swapping the Visconti with an FPR. Hopefully someone does better things with it than the 3 sticky pads I filled up with important dates.

Diamine Green/Black is a nice ink. But the green, to me, looks pretty faded. I barely ever fill a pen with it. Even with white lightning, it dries out with your pen uncapped in about 20 seconds. If you want to try this ink, it's free with either purchase. Otherwise, I may just take the loss and throw it out.

Shipping is included with both(the baoer's cost is literally the shipping). If you buy before Friday at 5pm, I can have it shipped out before the weekend. If not, it'll be shipped out on Monday when the campus PO opens up.

Today I have for you a classic Pilot Vanishing Point Matte Black 18k &lt;F&gt;, that I would rate a [B]. I bought it brand new a month ago and decided didn’t fit my writing style. It’s in great condition and will come with original box, papers, and CON-40.

Secondly, I have a Pilot Custom Heritage 92 14k &lt;M&gt;, rated a [C], which I bought second-hand in November. It’s a fantastic pen which I have no complaints about, but I’m selling it as I have recently acquired a Pilot Custom 823 which is... honestly, just better in every way. The pen functions as you’d expect from a Pilot gold nib, but has some staining from using mainly purple inks - the barrel and grip have noticeable purple stains (pictured). This pen, as it’s second hand, will not come with the original box or papers. 

The CH92 is yours for $130 CAD, or $100 USD. Same shipping policy as with the VP.

Re-posting this great pen at a reduced price. If your unfamiliar with the model, its very similar to the Custom 843, but its opaque black and uses a con-70 rather than the integrated vacuum filling system. This makes it slightly lighter weight, easier to clean and change inks, and more forward weighted. These differences make it the choice for some pilot lovers.

You will save around $40-45 dollars in shipping and tax buying it new here rather than importing a new one from japan off ebay, Amazon, etc.

The pen does post well although I feel like its not necessary with this particular pen.  The nib is your standard JoWo F nib, smooth and reliable but nothing to call home about and the schmidt converter works well and is reliable. One of the cool things about this pen is that it can eyedropper well, and you can add some grease on the threads and just eyedropper whatever inks you like.

Up for sale today is a pen by the Canadian maker London Pen Company. This beautiful pen was turned using the Tiffany #1 blank by Blanks by BBC, which has some shimmer and oh-so-slightly demonstrator elements in parts of the pen. I tried capturing the look of the pen by snapping a few photos of the pen. It comes in a JoWo #6 medium nib and standard international converter.

This pen has never been used or inked. I bought it in the flurry of stress-shopping I did earlier in the year, but upon reflection, I can't afford to keep all of these pens, so I have been letting go of them, one at a time. If you have any questions about the pen, I'd be happy to answer them.

I’ve got a Pilot Custom 74 in Smoke gray looking for a new home. The pen writes beautifully, it’s just a bit too fine for me and I’m not really reaching for it anymore.

There is a little bit of micro scratching (mainly on the band), and some ink staining on the end of the section where the nib and feed sit (see third photo). The staining isn’t visible when the pen is inked up, so it never really bothered me, but you may have better luck getting it out if you’ve got an ultrasonic cleaner. Pen has been fully cleaned and flushed and comes with a Con-70 converter but no box.

OK, friends, here's a very big fish. **EDIT: And it has been gobbled up \[SOLD\].**

Just right upfront: this is **$1440 shipped OBO, CONUS only**. I'll consider trades for pens in Omas burkina celluloid---particularly the Ogiva and the Moro Stylos Oldwin Classic. I may also consider trades for a Danitrio with a F or XF nib, or a Namiki Emperor with an F.

I got this pen a couple years ago and just . . . have never used it. The original idea was, *Oh, this would be a fine stub to use.* But I don't really use stubs; I don't have a lot of purpose for a pen that holds just over 3.5 mL ink that never gets to take advantage of that volume. Sending it off to have the nib reduced to an XF was considered but never decided.

So, after I kind of thought aloud in another user's recent post about the idea of selling and got some immediate interested reactions, I ruminated. And here it is.

This is a Danitrio Mikado Ao-tamenuri red flat-top clipless model with the eyedropper filling system. Urushi-lacquered ebonite with artist's signature on the piston knob. Danitrio's gorgeous stamped #8 Bock 18K nib. Huge: about 6.4"" long when capped. Note that in the writing sample I call this a ""'M' stub"", which I thought I recalled being the listed size when I originally bought the pen, but I was wrong---it's a roughly 1.1 stub, not properly anything like a medium.

It comes in a Danitrio-branded wood pen coffin, with a glass eyedropper for filling and a small cloth for polishing. I'll include a little tub of silicone grease as well. Rated \[B\].

So, u/hautehoro and u/NobleSixSeven and u/ShreyaSSSSM, who have asked about this previously, here you go.

1. SOLD ~~**KaZe pen, blue/white acetate, #5 black matte broad architect nib from FPNibs - \[B\] condition, \[D\] for nib swap**~~: got from another Pen\_Swapper. the lovely pen body is by a Chinese company (here's [two other colorways of the same pen](https://twitter.com/headbondmelwj/status/1324230483740254209?lang=en) they apparently produced for MDZS, for you C-drama nerds out there), and the original owner swapped in this gorgeous, extremely line variation-tastic architect nib (see writing sample) - very thin downstrokes, very wide horizontal strokes. I have been draaaaagging my feet on giving this up, because I adore everything about this pen. The catch: the architect nib is very cleanly, sharply done, which means both that its line variation is huge &amp; that it accommodates a \*very\* specific writing angle - it's pretty much exactly 45 degrees. I found out the hard way that I write mostly around 60-70 degrees, so writing with this pen never felt natural or easy for me. It should be used, so out into the world it goes. Its original converter arrived broken, and the process of replacing it was a slight adventure, but it's fine now.

Today, I am selling two steel nib pens.

**medium Benu Euphoria Pink Guava \[A2\]**. I bought this pen back in December and inked it once. It is a real nice pen, looks absolutely stunning and writes well. I just find that I opt to chose other pens in my collection over this one. It comes with a converter, its original box and all the original paperwork. **Asking $100.**

**Broad TWSBI diamond 580alr punch pink \[B\].** This pen was an impulse buy, and I have only used it a few times. Everything works fine and there is no damage to the pen, I'm just not crazy about the broad nib. This comes with the box shown in the picture, the wrench for disassembling the pen and a mostly full bottle of silicon grease. **Asking $55 OBO**",[WTS] Benu Euphoria Pink Guava and TWSBI diamond 580alr punch pink

Continuing trimming down my collection.
Up for sale 4 fountain pens as a bundle, not splitting at this time.

Pilot Metropolitan black [A2]: inked once, no signs of use, your choice of M or Stub nib, comes with original converter 

Delike white [A2]: inked once, no signs of use. Has an M nib, comes with original converter.

Pilot Kakuno [A2]: inked once, no signs of use. Your choice of F or M nib. This pen doesn’t come with converter so I will include some carts (both empty and full)

Nemosine Fission [D]: inked once, no signs of use. Marked D because it comes with Goulet/Jowo F nib instead of Nemosine nib. Comes with converter.

This makes the pen lighter than its stainless steel counterpart and a different feel. This is an absolutely gorgeous pen and would compliment any existing collection. The bold nib on the Black Amber writes a smooth, wet line, consistent with the platinum-coated 14k nibs on the other Lamy 2000 fountain pens. This pen is in flawless condition. This pen is numbered 4310/5000. ~~$350~~ $325 14k B nib

See a review here: [Here](https://www.gentlemanstationer.com/blog/2019/3/30/pen-review-montegrappa-monte-grappa). I really don’t want to let this one go, but at the moment #lifegoals mean I need fewer pens and more cash. Piston-filler, butter-smooth Jowo medium steel nib. As good as any of my gold nibs, honestly. The attention to detail on this pen is phenomenal. My favorite: the cap always screws on so that it’s lined up with the logo on the barrel. Love the little mountains on the imprint, the “1912” on the finial. I literally have a second verification picture because I’ve been vacillating on selling this beauty, but I'm putting her out there for your writing pleasure.

The color is a translucent green (that represents the color of champagne bottles, hence the name.) The 21K extra-fine nib has that classic Sailor feel without being scratchy.

The modern steel flex nib is very fun. Certainly not vintage flex, but plenty of line variation to be had, and I found it to feel much less likely to spring so this would be a great choice for someone looking for their first flex nib.

I will also be including a Kaweco converter (the pen originally came only with carts). The hooded steel nib is a nice, smooth writer, maybe a tad on the wetter side.

Hello everybody! I got something pretty fun today for your consideration. 

A while ago my mum made my a pen sleeve for me after learning about ~~my addiction~~ my collecting, and then asked if some of you guy here would be interested in something like this! 

I figured it wouldn't hurt to see, and so she sent a couple my way to put up here! I've been using mine for about 2 years now and has been holding up fantastic, and in these images I put some size comparisons to give you an idea of how big they are. 

The boarders are hand stitched and the separators are machine, so each has some character. The large carriers have 6 slots (some have a smaller 7th perfect for mechanical pencils) 
PLEASE NOTE! Some pens with clips that sit lower on the cap like old watermans and sheaffers will sit higher in the sleeve making it close awkwardly!!


Here they are inventory wise:

  -LARGE
•1 light blue with gold flecked dots (7 slots)
•1 red with a kind of  Paisley pattern (7 slots)
•1light blue with geometric floral pattern (7 slots)

The converter is a mite too big for the pen body but I was able to use this converter with this pen without any problems. -- $90 shipped CONUS More pics: https://imgur.com/a/846pH9g

&amp;nbsp;

[ALBUM &amp; TIMESTAMP](https://imgur.com/a/QrHEGdX)

&amp;nbsp;

Pastable link: https://imgur.com/a/QrHEGdX

&amp;nbsp;

**Condition (n.b.):** All pens listed below have been disassembled, cleaned and restored with new sacs installed in the last couple weeks. *Each of these pens is guaranteed to fill and write as designed without leaks or other problems. Nibs have been adjusted when necessary to ensure that all lay down a smooth and consistent line.*

**THESE PENS HAVE NO CRACKS, CHIPS, PERSONALIZATIONS, LOOSE OR MISSING PARTS, BENT NIBS, MISALIGNED TINES, OR THREADING ISSUES.**

&amp;nbsp;

**Line Widths and Writing Samples:** To provide buyers with as much information as possible, I have started to adopt the following line width standards: XXF (.1-.2mm); XF (approx .3mm); F (approx .4mm); M (approx .6mm); B (approx .8mm). Nib flexibility is determined by variation (max line width under pressure) and softness (amount of pressure). Flexibility designations based on variation generally run as follows for an XF/F nib: Semi-Flex (approx. 1mm); Flex (1.2-1.9mm);  Superflex (&gt;2mm). All line width measurements are taken with a digital caliper but should be considered approximations providing a general guide. Width may vary slightly depending on type of ink and paper used as well as amount of pressure applied. All writing samples are on Rhodia dot paper using Waterman Serenity Blue or Omas Grey.

&amp;nbsp;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;nbsp;

~~**1. 1920s Eclipse Deluxe Greek Key Ring Top** (chased blue celluloid(!), GPT, lever filler, 14k F/M Flex/Superflex Factory Stub). Measures 4 1/2"" capped and 5 3/4"" posted. This pen lacks a maker's mark but has the distinctive stout, wreathed lever of the Eclipse company of New York City. It's made up of an unusual and unusually fetching combination of navy blue celluloid chased in the Greek Key (or Grecian Border) pattern, complemented by multiple gold-plated rings and one white inset ring on the cap. Another interesting detail: the original sales price of the pen ($3.00) is actually imprinted on the barrel-end in a bubbly font (faint but legible). 14k Warranted nib offers the delightful synthesis of Flexible softness verging on Superflex and Factory Stubitude. Unflexed, lays down a smooth and consistent F/M line on the down-strokes and XF line on the cross-strokes. Under light to moderate pressure, that line widens to a 4B+ (approx 2.0mm). A versatile nib well suited to adding flair to everyday note-taking as it is to expressive correspondence with reliable flow over its full range of flex (see [WRITING SAMPLE](https://imgur.com/VLxhsHi)). **Condition:** excellent [B]. No notable wear to the gold-plated hardware aside from a spot of brassing on the lever spade and thin sliver around the bottom edge of the cap band on one side of cap. Celluloid surface is smooth and lustrous with no deep scratches or other significant blemishes. Price: $140~~ **SOLD**

&amp;nbsp;

~~**2. 1920s Eclipse Ring Top** (red, celluloid, GPT, lever filler, 14k M Flex/Superflex nib). Measures 4 1/2"" capped and 5 5/16"" posted. This pen lacks a maker's mark but has the distinctive stout, wreathed lever of the Eclipse company of New York City. It's made of a celluloid that resembles Parker's red Permanite, manufactured to reproduce the original color of the red hard rubber Duofold. Gold-plated lever with Eclipse's robust lever box. Turned groove around the cap from the factory instead of a metal cap band indicates that this was a model lower in price than was #1 above (alas, no price imprint on this one). 14k Warranted nib yields Superflexible variation with Flexible softness. It lays down a smooth and consistent M line that widens to a 4B+ (approx 2.0mm) under moderate pressure (see [WRITING SAMPLE](https://imgur.com/Dq7oSgq)). Reliable flow over its full range of flex. A great choice for expressive and calligraphic writing styles. **Condition:** excellent [B]. Gold-plated hardware is clean apart from a short sliver of wear to the center of the lever. Celluloid surface is smooth and lustrous with no deep scratches or other significant blemishes – just a pin-sized nick here and there. Price: $90~~ **SOLD**

&amp;nbsp;

~~**3. 1920s Diamond Medal Emblem Ring Top** (Mahogany, celluloid, GFT, lever filler, 14k XF Superflex nib). One of the larger ring tops of the time, measuring 4 13/16"" capped and 6 1/8"" posted. Diamond Medal pens were made by the National Pen Products company: a massive conglomerate also known for Gold Medal, Gold Bond, and Lincoln pens as well as its collaborations with Parker, Wahl-Eversharp, and Waterman in producing re-branded Vacumatics, Dorics, No. 7s, etc. for large retail chains such as Montgomery Ward and Sears. This model featured a custom emblem on the cap band chosen by the customer at the point of purchase, as illustrated in this [PERIOD ADVERT](https://imgur.com/iwmTCIP) from the Sears &amp; Roebuck catalogue. The original owner of this pen chose a stylized 'R'. The body of the pen is made of celluloid in a woodgrain pattern DM called ""Mahogany."" I've seen these crop up with either nibs marked Diamond Medal or Warranted, so the 14k #4 Twinpoint nib on this one must be a replacement – though the name does chime with ""Diamond Point."" I haven't been able turn up anything about the Twinpoint company, but it's a high-quality nib with finishing every bit as nice as that of nibs from the Big Four makers. A Super-Flexible writer, it lays down a smooth and consistent XF line that widens to a 4B+ (approx 2.2mm) under light pressure (see [WRITING SAMPLE](https://imgur.com/D7ew3Ek)). Thin hairlines, responsive snap-back, and reliable flow over its full range of flex make it an ideal choice for calligraphic writing styles such as Copperplate and Spencerian. **Condition:** cosmetically excellent [B]; fair [C] for replacement nib. Gold-filled trim is clean aside from a sliver of brassing along the bottom edge of the cap band and another on the edge of the lever. Celluloid surface shows some nicks and scratches here and there but nothing terribly unsightly. Manufacturer imprint on the barrel is sharp, deep, and fully legible (see [DETAIL PHOTO](https://imgur.com/VgIIKnB)). Price: $160~~ **SOLD**

&amp;nbsp;

~~**4. 1920s National Ring Top** (pastel blue, celluloid, GPT, lever filler, 14k XF Flex nib). Measures 4 1/2"" capped and 5 3/4"" posted. This pen lacks a maker's mark but has a lever identical to the Diamond Medal's above. In the writing sample I tentatively identified it as a Diamond Medal, but I think it'd be more accurate to attribute it to National, the maker of DM pens (i.e. the brand rather than the DM sub-brand). For more on the National Pen Products company, see #3 above. This pen is made of celluloid in a sort of robin egg's blue color complemented by gold-plated trim. Flexible 14k Warranted #3 nib lays down a smooth and consistent XF line that widens to a 3B+ (approx 1.8mm) under moderate pressure (see [WRITING SAMPLE](https://imgur.com/hR0bx53)). Thin hairlines, strong snap-back, and reliable flow over its full range of flex make it a great choice for expressive writing styles. **Condition:** excellent [B]. Gold-plated hardware is clean aside from a shadow of wear around the bottom of the cap band. Celluloid surface is smooth and lustrous with no deep scratches or other significant blemishes. Price: $90~~ **SOLD**

&amp;nbsp;

~~**5. 1920s Ingersoll Twist Filler** (black, celluloid, GPT + NPT, twist filler, 14k XF Flex nib). Measures a hair under 4 1/2"" capped and 5 1/2"" posted.  Founded by Charles H. Ingersoll, brother of Robert H. Ingersoll of Ingersoll Dollar Watch fame, the Ingersoll pen company was originally located in Newark, New Jersey. Today it's chiefly known for its bestselling, twist-filling Dollar Pen, whose 14k nib made it a great value at the time. Instead of a lever and pressure bar to compress the sac inside the barrel, this pen features a milled knob at the end of the barrel that actually twists the sac when turned, fully compressing it at roughly 1.5 turns. After letting the knob spring back, the sac reinflates, yielding an even more capacious fill than does a lever. A simple, convenient filling system, but not so simple to restore (though I've gotten the hang of it after doing a handful of these over the years). This twist-filler is made of black celluloid with a decorative white band crowning the cap. Flexible 14k Ingersoll nib lays down a smooth and consistent XF line that widens to a 3B+ (approx 1.7mm) under moderate pressure (see [WRITING SAMPLE](https://imgur.com/66LGhjk)). Thin hairlines, strong snap-back, and reliable flow over its full range of flex make it a great choice for expressive writing styles. **Condition:** excellent [B]. Gold-plated ring top and stainless steel filling knob show no brassing or other notable wear. Celluloid surface is smooth and lustrous with no deep scratches or other significant blemishes. Manufacturer imprint on the top of the cap(!) is sharp, deep, and fully legible. Price: $110~~ **SOLD**

&amp;nbsp;

~~**6. 1920s-30s Blue Streak** (blue and cream streak, celluloid, GPT, lever filler, 14k M Superflex Factory Stub). Measures 4 3/8"" capped and 5 1/2"" posted. This pen has no markings and there's no other indication of a maker so I've baptized it the ""Blue Streak."" It's made of a cream and blue streaked celluloid complemented by gold-plated trim. Super-Flexible 14k Warranted nib is also a Factory Stub. Unflexed, it lays down a smooth and consistent M line on the down-strokes and F line on the cross-strokes. Under light pressure, that line widens to a 4B+ (approx 2.2mm) (see [WRITING SAMPLE](https://imgur.com/2EjTuqz)). Using Waterman's Serenity Blue, I experienced some railroading, but switching to Omas Grey solved the problem entirely (the writing sample is a mixture since I forgot to flush). This is to say that some ink experimentation might be in order to find which flow best in this pen. A wet and versatile writer for expressive writing in a larger hand. **Condition:** very good [C]. Gold-plated hardware is clean aside from slivers of brassing on the side edges of the lever. Celluloid surface shows its age, honestly. I polished it to a high luster but it's covered in little dings and nicks. The bottom of the barrel beneath the lever shows the worst of em. More of a user, then, but a lovely writer all the same. Price: $110~~ **SOLD**

So, like many people, I saw this pen when it launched and fell in love. When I received it I even named her Mnemosyne. I am on the verge of a big move and have come to terms with something I already knew when I bought the pen: I don't like Pelikans. My Vanishing Points have ruined me. Despite my great lust for its beauty, I will never choose to write with this pen over others in my collection, and so I am ready to part with her. Please give her a good home.

The nib is a custom ground XXF from Pablo at [FPnibs.com](https://FPnibs.com). It is a smooth writer, but as to be expected with a very fine point, it is toothy. The original stock EF I ordered her with is included, as is the original presentation box and documentation. Writing sample comparing the two nibs is included in the linked gallery with the timestamp.

For sale here is a Montblanc 149 (Condition Rated as C) from either the 1970s or the early 1980s. Pen is fitted with a juicy two-tone 14C nib. Feed is split ebonite, and pen has plastic piston filler threads, which makes for a much lighter pen, an important consideration for a pen this size! The pen is in wonderful shape overall. Body has no huge anomalies, no personalizations, only the usual signs of careful use one could expect for a pen of this vintage.

Mechanically the pen is in excellent working order. The piston moves smoothly and works as designed. And the nib (as you could see in the writing sample) is in great shape as well. A smooth, juicy fine point, that has a bit of Hebrew/Arabic/architect character which was just the way Montblanc ground their fine nibs in those days. Though certainly not flexible, nib does have a wee-bit of give to it, making for a nice cushioned writing experience.

This pen also just got back from a tune-up by u/pentuner. So this pen is ready for more years of service when you get it. Selling this to reduce my collection.

Asking price is $475. Included in the price are insured CONUS Priority Mail shipping and PayPal fees. Payment will be by PayPal Goods and Services only. And in accordance to PayPal rules, pen will be sent to address reflected in the PayPal transaction.

I’m always on the lookout for some ink samples in the UK, as they are usually quite hard to find here. My glass vials have just arrived so I can now send samples. I have a very limited ink collection (most of these are samples from others), but if anyone wants to buy or trade, let me know. This also means that for a lot of them, once its taken its gone. One final word of warning, I will prioritise trades as I have had some very kind contributions to this selection ( u/baskerville667 and u/deafndepressed ) and dont eant ti abuse their kindness.

**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**\[D\] Red and Gold Vintage Sheaffer** \- Im not sure what exact model this is as its been too long to remember. I got it at an antique store a couple years back and restored it my self. When I was restoring the pen I made a small mistake that has resulted in the knob on the back to not be able to screw down all the way, I also took the sac out at some point (I think I was using the pen without the sac protector so that the back would close all the way, sac got chewed up) so this is *kinda* a for parts pen. Im sure this could probably be fully functional for pretty cheep as I had it up and going all by my self at some point. I will also note that the body has an engraving on it and has a lovely 14k nib that was one of my favorite writers when I was using it.   - **W 30$ shipped**

*note: i do have extra sacs for this pen that i have no real use for as well as some shelack for it, i can send it with on request*

**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**\[D\] Pen BBS Black Twisy Boy** \- This is a pen bbs pen I got a couple years ago, but with a twist. I put an opus stub nib on it and gave it a huge ink channel. The converter has always slowly leaked ink ever sense I got the pen, which is not a super huge deal as long as you don't bring it anywhere, but even then its not that bad. As you might imagine the is quite the paint brush which is rather fun every once and a while, but I have a new favorite paint brush nowadays. Over all this is a fun and little but jank set up. - **W 15$ shipped**

**\[D\] Pelikan 205 Clear** \- This is a pelikan that I got used on this subreddit a while back, just as good as when I got it. Simply have other demos I like more and is too small for me. It does have a small crack on the cap but its pretty hard to see on the say to day honestly I usually forget about it. - **W 50$ shipped**

I am wanting to trade this lightly used TWSBI Draco (filled once) for TWSBI Aurora, any nib, preferably in Fine Medium or Broad.

The Draco has a fine nib, however I also have a TWSBI 580al Rose Gold with a Broad nib that I can swap into the Draco. 

Since I am requesting a trade, we would buy each others pen, that's what I've done in the past and is probably best.

^(Listed below from left to right.)

1. ~~Pilot Automac .5mm mechanical pencil \[A1\]~~ **~~$40~~** **SOLD** \- Pilot's discontinued flagship pencil. It's new with tags, no dings or any other wear whatsoever. Still has 99% of the original lead inside. These are hard to find right now, eBay and Amazon have them for around $100.
2. *Platinum Dia-Gata*, Semiflex 14k F nib \[D\] **~~$180~~** **$170** \- This 1950s Platinum is a very rare model, made with inlaid magnesium chips, and was originally sold with a steel nib. I removed the cap band because I prefer how it looks without it, thus the D rating. I've upgraded the nib to a beautiful, period-correct #4 gold nib made by Platinum. Just a dream to write with, a snappy and precise semi-flex from an isolated island in the 1950s. For reference an example with the cap band and a rather boring steel nib sold for $240 last year.
3. *~~Pink Pilot Elite~~*~~, 18k F nib \[C\]~~ **~~$60~~** **SOLD-** Nice pocket pen from the 70s. The nib feels similar to a modern custom 74. There are a few marks on the cap, and the bright pink section shows some signs of use. Ready to write daily!
4. *~~Pilot Grandam~~*~~, 14k F nib \[B\]~~ **~~$70~~** **~~$65~~** **SOLD** \- made around 1979 this pen has a very soft nib, which is similar in size to the modern #3 nibs. CC filled, in nice condition for a 42-year-old pen. This pen sort of reminds me of a pelikan m200.
5. *~~Pilot Custom Black Stripe~~*~~, 18k F nib \[B\]~~ **~~$90~~** **SOLD** **-** A Pilot classic, made in 1974. This pen is in great condition compared to most black stripes. A true gem!
6. *~~Pilot Elite~~*~~, 18k SF nib \[C\]~~ **~~$70~~** **SOLD-** Another classic of the '80s, this SF nib is beautiful to write with. There's a slight bit of chipping to the enamel near the crown, but other than that the pen looks pristine. Perfect for daily carry!

The Artist who created and signed this piece by hand - Yasunori Sakomoto went on to be a lead Namiki craftsman, and as far as I'm aware he exclusively works on Emperors and limited editions now. There is some wear to one of the bird's wings, and a sliver of the brass body is showing on the cap lip (both can be seen near my thumb in the first image). The nib is 18k, whereas normal pilot nibs are 14k. Maki-e's are given the softer, higher karat nibs. Adjusted for inflation, this pen retailed for \~$2400 USD. Original box and ink bottle included. A true masterpiece, blending tradition with modern grace. Photos added per request.

[~~Platinum 3776 'Moonlit Night' Maki-e~~](https://imgur.com/a/qNukaPc)~~, 14k M nib \[B\]~~ **~~$500~~** **~~$480~~** **$460 SOLD** \- Made in the late '80s by artist Ippei, this beautiful 3776 was only released in the Japanese market. Ebonite base, decorated with Urushi and Maki-e. These 3776s made by Ippei are incredibly rare, only surfacing in Japan once every few years. In my opinion, this is one of the greatest maki-e compositions of all time (coming from an enthusiast with thousands of vintage references). The rich, golden amber flowers and leaves softly flow throughout the curvature of the pen. illuminated by the crescent moon above. You won't find this anywhere else.

# Overview: 

This is a vintage Wilwrite fountain pen made of black ebonite. It is a lever-filler and features a wide gold cap band. It is a ring-top pen, so it can be attached to a necklace or chain. It is a bit short but posts into a comfortable size. Wilwrite was based in New York but often used parts manufactured by other companies, a common practice for 2nd tier pens. The pen itself was likely made in the late 20's, making it nearly a century old.

# Writing:

The pen has a 14K gold Wilwrite nib. It is soft and semi-flexible with moderate ink flow. It writes an approximate fine to medium line and is smooth with a hint of feedback. The tipping is worn down with a little remaining, so it likely saw a lot of use during it's time.

# Condition (C): 

The pen has been fully serviced and is ready to write. The pen was disassembled, cleaned, and had a new sac and pressure bar installed. A deoxidizing solution was used to restore the ebonite's black color. It was then lightly polished, and had an oil and wax mix applied to it to protect it. The gold trims were lightly polished.

Overall, the pen is in great shape. There are no cracks, major marks, or personalizations. The chased pattern is worn on the pen, so it is rather faint and looks smooth instead. The gold trims are all in good shape with no chips or brassing, although they do show some scratches. Overall, it is a lovely and classic looking pen that is near a century old.

As the title suggests, I have two Leonardo 14k gold 1.3mm stub nibs that I would like to trade or sell. Stub nibs used to be my favorite, but over the past year or so I have fallen out of love with them. As such, I'm looking to replace all of my stub nibs. I have two stub nibs, an older style \[D\] (right) one and a newer style one \[C\] (left). The old one did not write well when I purchased it, so I sent it off to Kirk Speer who was able to make it write wonderfully. The newer style one happened to write well out of the box. Neither one has been used much, but they both do have micro scratches. Both include just the nib, not the feed or housing unit. 

I'm pretty open to nib sizes, with my preference looking like this: elastic &gt; music &gt; ef &gt; f &gt; and then possibly m. I realize the elastic or music nib is unlikely, but if you did want to trade for a stub, I would be willing to add a little bit of money to the trade. I would also consider selling the nibs outright for $155 shipped a piece. Additionally, I would consider a 14K JoWo or Bock nib to trade.",[WTS/WTT} Two Leonardo 14k Gold 1.3mm Stub Nibs

Hello, I bought this beautiful little Sailor last year, but it I find the Pro Gear Slim too small for my hands. I have only inked it twice, once when I got it last april, and now. Between these times it never left its case... So the condition is excellent, yet inked, thus A2.

~~First is a Franklin Christoph Model 02 finished in Maya blue and Nuclear green. This pen is absolutely beautiful and I waited a couple of years for a colorway like this one to become available. This was a limited release of 25 pens back in February of this year and it has been used sparingly (~1.5 converters of ink) over the last month. I love everything about this pen except for the weight. It is a bit too light for my tastes so maybe someone who missed out on this amazing colorway can enjoy it. Asking $170 shipped. Includes all paperwork, leather pen sleeve, and box. Please feel free to reach out with offers or questions.~~

~~/Next I have a matte black pilot vanishing point with a stub ground to a smooth cursive italic. I believe this grind was done by nibtuner, but I am not 100% sure. I have been studying grinds of other nibmeisters to help in my learning process and this has been a great nib. This nib has shown me how thin the cross strokes can be while remaining very smooth and comfortable. This pen would surely make anyone looking for a bit of line variation in their EDC very happy. Asking $130 shipped. Includes a vanishing point box and papers./~~

Finally I have a black carbonesque vanishing point with a very nice medium nib. This pen has been in my rotation for quite some time, but has been used mainly at my desk for notes and letters. Asking $120 shipped. Includes a vanishing point box and papers. 

I can swap the nib units in the vanishing points if there is any interest. 

All prices are negotiable and I am more than happy to work with you if you are interested in more than one pen. Please feel free to reach out with any and all trade offers. (The worst I can say is that I'm not interested) I am mainly looking for a pilot myu or rotring 600 for trades, but anything metal may fit the bill. I will probably post a few other pens this weekend in an effort to slim down the collection so be on the lookout.
